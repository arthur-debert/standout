//! Questionnaire answer sheets: render a prose questionnaire, collect answers
//! interactively or from a document, and decode them by stable identity
//! through one shared validation pipeline. The sheet format, the compatibility
//! contract and the sensitive-content guidance are in
//! `standout-input/docs/topics/answer-sheets.md`.
//!
//! This crate owns the reusable machinery: definition validation, rendering,
//! parsing, collection adapters, field decoding and validation, and
//! diagnostics. The application owns its questionnaire definition, whole-form
//! rules (a closure passed to [`Questionnaire::decode_answers_with`]),
//! interactive flow, review, confirmation, and side effects.
//!
//! A line is a *question line* iff it ends with a stable `<id:...>` tag as its
//! last non-whitespace content; everything before the tag is cosmetic and the
//! answer is everything up to the next question line. There is no escaping: an
//! answer that itself ends in a schema-valid tag reads as a question line, and
//! a stray `<id:` in answer text only raises a warning
//! ([`RawAnswers::warnings`]). A repeatable [`Group`]'s submitted instances are
//! addressed by *occurrence path* (`command.inputs[1].name`), and the index
//! belongs to the answer, never to the definition or the fingerprint.
//!
//! One blank rule applies everywhere: a blank answer resolves to the declared
//! default first; without one, a blank optional field is an omission and a
//! blank required field is a missing-value error. A populated *inactive*
//! conditional field ([`ScalarField::active_when`]) is an error rather than
//! silently discarded. A dynamic default
//! ([`ScalarField::with_dynamic_default`]) is a closure over earlier answers
//! paired with a mandatory revision, which enters the fingerprint in the static
//! default's place because a closure can't be hashed. Interactive collection
//! re-prompts only on a failed *entered* answer; batch collection accumulates
//! every diagnostic from one pass.
//!
//! The fingerprint covers every property that changes accepted answers and
//! ignores wording, numbering and ordering; it is a compatibility checksum, not
//! a tamper check. That is the contract of [`StandoutAnswerSheet`], the default
//! [`AnswerSheetFormat`]; an application whose own spec pins the sheet's shape
//! supplies another and shares at most the tagged body
//! ([`Questionnaire::parse_answer_sheet_body`]).
