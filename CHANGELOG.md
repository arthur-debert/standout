## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Hook system for pre/post command execution** - Register custom callbacks that run before and after command handlers execute
  - `pre_dispatch` hooks: Run before command handler, can abort execution
  - `post_output` hooks: Run after output is generated, can transform output or abort
  - Multiple hooks can be chained at each phase
  - Full access to `ArgMatches` and `CommandContext` in hook functions
- New `Output` enum for hook output handling:
  - `Output::Text(String)` - Text output from templates
  - `Output::Binary(Vec<u8>, String)` - Binary output with filename
  - `Output::Silent` - No output
- `HookError` type with phase information (`PreDispatch` / `PostOutput`)
- `Hooks::new()` builder with fluent `.pre_dispatch()` and `.post_output()` methods

### Example

```rust
use outstanding_clap::{Outstanding, Hooks, Output, HookError};

Outstanding::builder()
    .command("list", handler, template)
    .hooks("list", Hooks::new()
        .pre_dispatch(|matches, ctx| {
            println!("Running: {}", ctx.command_path.join(" "));
            Ok(())
        })
        .post_output(|matches, ctx, output| {
            // Transform or inspect output
            Ok(output)
        }))
    .run_and_print(cmd, args);
```
