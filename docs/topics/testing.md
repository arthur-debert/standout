# Testing

Standout treats testability as a primary design constraint, not an afterthought. This page is the reference view: how Standout's layers compose to make a CLI testable, which seams the framework exposes, and where each testing technique fits.

For the tutorial introduction — how to *use* `TestHarness` starting from a small surface — see [Introduction to Testing](../guides/intro-to-testing.md).

## Why this section exists

Most CLI frameworks punt on testing. Users end up with one of two patterns: (a) a tangled handler they can't unit test, tested only via subprocess + regex on stdout; (b) a split architecture they enforce by convention, with scaffolding to match mocks to sources duplicated across every test file. Standout tries to make the clean path the easy path.

This is a mix of architectural choices (which move more testable code closer to the surface) and concrete tooling (`standout-test`, environment detectors, default reader shims).

## Three levels, three tools

A Standout app has three testing layers, each appropriate to a different kind of change:

| Level | What it covers | Tool | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | A single handler's logic, as a pure function | Plain `#[test]` + direct call | Microseconds |
| Integration | Full dispatch pipeline in-process: argv → handler → render | `standout-test::TestHarness` | Microseconds to low milliseconds |
| End-to-end | Real process, real PTY, real signals, real subprocess fan-out | `assert_cmd`, `expectrl`, `rexpect` | Tens to hundreds of milliseconds per test |

Choose by what the change touches. A bug in a filter predicate belongs in level 1. A bug in "does this command actually read `$TODO_FILE`?" belongs in level 2. A bug in raw-mode TUI redraw belongs in level 3 — and is a signal to look hard at whether the logic in question could be extracted.

## What each layer gives you for free

### Handlers are pure functions

The `HandlerResult<T>` contract is that a handler takes `&ArgMatches` + `&CommandContext` and returns a serializable value. It doesn't touch stdout. It doesn't render. It returns data.

This alone covers the majority of a real CLI's logic surface. You test handlers the way you test any Rust function: construct inputs, call, assert on the output struct. No stdout capture, no regex.

For the canonical example, see [the Introduction to Standout](../guides/intro-to-standout.md#2-hard-split-logic-and-formatting). The key invariant is that *nothing about the handler depends on terminal state*.

### Clap is already tested

Argument parsing is clap's responsibility, and clap has an extensive test suite of its own. You don't need to rewrite those tests; you just need to trust the seam. If you have truly exotic arg-parsing logic, test it by calling `Command::try_get_matches_from(...)` directly — that's clap's in-process API.

### Rendering is already tested

`standout-render` has snapshot tests for MiniJinja template evaluation, CSS parsing, style resolution, tag transforms, tabular layouts, and every output mode. Again, you don't need to re-test it — you need to test that *your* templates render the shape of data you think they do. The harness covers that naturally by running the full pipeline.

## What the harness adds

`TestHarness` (in the `standout-test` crate) is the unified in-process runner. It wraps `App::run_to_string` with fluent setup for every injectable piece of state:

- Env vars (real `std::env::set_var`, originals captured and restored on drop)
- Working directory (real `std::env::set_current_dir`, original restored on drop)
- Fixture files (written into a `tempfile::TempDir`)
- Terminal detectors: width, TTY, color capability
- Stdin reader (process-global override consulted by `StdinSource::new()`)
- Clipboard reader (same mechanism for `ClipboardSource::new()`)
- Forced `OutputMode` (injected as `--output=<mode>` into argv)

A `RestoreState` held inside the returned `TestResult` runs on drop — on both normal exit and panic unwind — and tears down every override, so a failing assertion never leaks state into sibling tests. Two nuances worth knowing:

- **Env vars and cwd** are restored to the values captured at `run()` time. This is a true "put it back the way you found it."
- **Terminal detectors and default stdin/clipboard readers** are reset to the library defaults, not to whatever was installed before `run()`. If you mix `TestHarness` with a manually installed `set_*_detector` / `set_default_*_reader` on the same thread, the harness's drop will wipe your override. Keep them separate, or scope the manual override entirely outside the harness.

The harness is `#[must_use]`: a `TestHarness::new()` without a `.run(...)` does nothing and gets flagged by the compiler.

See [Introduction to Testing](../guides/intro-to-testing.md) for the full builder tour.

## Environment seams exposed by the framework

The harness doesn't invent new mechanisms; it wires together seams that Standout exposes deliberately, all of which you can also use directly.

### `standout-render::environment`

The render crate exposes three overridable detectors:

```rust
use standout_render::{
    set_terminal_width_detector, set_tty_detector, set_color_capability_detector,
    reset_environment_detectors, DetectorGuard,
};
```

Each takes a `fn() -> T` (function pointer or non-capturing closure). `DetectorGuard` is a RAII helper that resets all three on drop.

These drive `OutputMode::Auto`'s color decision and the render context's terminal width. Install an override in any test that snapshots rendered output, and the result becomes deterministic across machines.

### `standout-input` default readers

`StdinSource::new()` and `ClipboardSource::new()` resolve their reader through the `DefaultStdin` / `DefaultClipboard` shims. Each shim first consults a process-global override; if none is installed, it falls back to the real OS-backed reader.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use standout_input::{
    set_default_stdin_reader, reset_default_stdin_reader,
    set_default_clipboard_reader, reset_default_clipboard_reader,
};
use standout_input::env::{MockStdin, MockClipboard};

set_default_stdin_reader(Arc::new(MockStdin::piped("hello")));
// ... run test ...
reset_default_stdin_reader();
```

Handlers that use `StdinSource::new()` / `ClipboardSource::new()` / `read_if_piped()` pick up the mock transparently — no handler refactor needed.

Handlers that need per-instance control keep using `StdinSource::with_reader(MockStdin::piped(...))` as before.

### Env vars and cwd

These aren't proxied through a Standout abstraction — they're just real OS primitives. Use `std::env::set_var` / `std::env::set_current_dir` (directly or through the harness). The harness adds: (a) capture-and-restore around `.run()`, and (b) a tempdir per test for fixtures.

## Concurrency model

Every seam above is process-global. Parallel tests that mutate them will interfere with each other.

Use `#[serial]` from the `serial_test` crate (re-exported as `standout_test::serial`) on every test that uses `TestHarness` or any of the lower-level detectors. Within a test binary, serial execution is automatic; across test binaries, cargo runs one test binary at a time by default, so there's no extra coordination needed.

## Recipes

### Snapshot testing with `insta`

Pin terminal state for determinism, run, snapshot the output:

```rust
use insta::assert_snapshot;

#[test]
#[serial]
fn list_snapshot() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .fixture("todos.txt", "a\nb\nc\n")
        .terminal_width(80)
        .no_color()
        .run(&app(), command(), ["todo", "list"]);

    assert_snapshot!(result.stdout());
}
```

### Asserting JSON shape

Force `OutputMode::Json` to bypass the template and serialize the handler's data directly:

```rust
let result = TestHarness::new()
    .output_mode(OutputMode::Json)
    .run(&app, cmd, ["myapp", "list"]);

let v: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(result.stdout()).unwrap();
assert_eq!(v["todos"].as_array().unwrap().len(), 3);
```

### Testing a handler without going through dispatch

For pure logic tests, skip the harness entirely:

```rust
#[test]
fn filter_excludes_done_by_default() {
    let matches = Command::new("t")
        .arg(clap::Arg::new("all").long("all").action(clap::ArgAction::SetTrue))
        .try_get_matches_from(["t"])
        .unwrap();
    let ctx = CommandContext::default();

    let Output::Render(result) = list(&matches, &ctx).unwrap() else { panic!() };
    assert!(result.todos.iter().all(|t| matches!(t.status, Status::Pending)));
}
```

This path has no `#[serial]` requirement — nothing global is touched.

### Mixing levels

A common layout for a CLI crate:

```text
tests/
├── handlers.rs       # level 1 — direct handler calls
├── harness.rs        # level 2 — TestHarness integration tests
└── e2e.rs            # level 3 — assert_cmd for the few things the harness can't cover
```

Run them together with `cargo test`. Level 1 is by far the largest file; level 3 is usually less than a dozen tests.

## Boundaries

`TestHarness` is an in-process runner. It cannot simulate:

- **Real PTY.** `isatty()` on the real stdin file descriptor, raw-mode terminals, progress bars that depend on cursor control. Use `expectrl` / `rexpect` with a spawned subprocess.
- **Signals.** SIGINT / SIGTERM handling needs a real process.
- **Shelling out from your handler.** If a handler invokes `git`, `rg`, `$EDITOR`, etc., those run as real subprocesses in the test too. A `ProcessRunner` abstraction to address this is in progress (Phase 3 of the test-tooling work); until it lands, structure shell-outs behind a local trait you can swap for a mock in handler tests.
- **Build / linker integration.** Testing that the compiled binary has the right embedded resources, dependencies, or `--version` output is fair game for a small `assert_cmd` suite.

The goal is to keep level-3 tests small and intentional — the cases where you really do need a real process — and put everything else at level 1 or 2.
