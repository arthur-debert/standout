## Where to Start

If you're new to Standout, begin with [Introduction to Standout](./intro-to-standout.md). It walks through adopting Standout in an existing CLI, step by step.

For a quick overview without the explanations, see the [TLDR Quick Start](./tldr-intro-to-standout.md).

If you want to use the crates independently (without the full framework), start with the crate-specific guides above.
