# Testing Standout CLIs

This is the guide for testing CLIs built with Standout. It starts from a claim most people nod at but few act on — *"shell apps should be easy to test"* — and shows how Standout's architecture, combined with the `standout-test` crate, actually makes that true.

**See also:**

- [Handler Contract](../crates/dispatch/topics/handler-contract.md)
- [Testing (Topic)](../topics/testing.md) — reference for the `standout-test` API surface
- [Output Modes](../topics/output-modes.md)

## 1. The claim no one keeps

"Shell applications should be easy to test. Just keep logic separate from output."

Sure. And yet look at any CLI in the wild and count the tests that:

- Spawn the compiled binary as a subprocess
- Pipe some argv in
- Capture stdout
- Regex-match the output

That's not testing behavior. That's reverse-engineering the user interface on every run. When you test a function via its rendered output, every trivial copy change breaks the test. Every color tweak breaks the test. Every time you add an emoji, every time the column widths shift, every time a locale flips — broken tests.

The honest answer is that most CLI codebases *don't* keep logic and output cleanly separated, because there's no discipline enforcing it. `println!` is always one line away. The tests you end up writing reflect that: they're shell-out + regex, because the production code is too tangled to test any other way.

## 2. The free win: architecture

Standout's first contribution to testability has nothing to do with testing tools. It's the architecture itself.

A handler is a pure function:

```rust
pub fn list(m: &ArgMatches, ctx: &CommandContext) -> HandlerResult<TodoResult> {
    let show_all = m.get_flag("all");
    let todos = storage::list()?
        .into_iter()
        .filter(|t| show_all || matches!(t.status, Status::Pending))
        .collect();
    Ok(Output::Render(TodoResult { todos }))
}
```

Output is data. Rendering lives somewhere else — a template, a stylesheet. The handler never touches stdout.

This means you can test the handler the way you test any other Rust function:

```rust
#[test]
fn list_filters_completed_by_default() {
    let matches = build_matches(&["list"]);
    let ctx = CommandContext::default();

    let Output::Render(result) = list(&matches, &ctx).unwrap() else {
        panic!("expected Render");
    };

    assert!(result.todos.iter().all(|t| matches!(t.status, Status::Pending)));
}

#[test]
fn list_with_all_returns_everything() {
    let matches = build_matches(&["list", "--all"]);
    let ctx = CommandContext::default();

    let Output::Render(result) = list(&matches, &ctx).unwrap() else { panic!() };
    assert_eq!(result.todos.len(), storage::list().unwrap().len());
}
```

No stdout capture. No regex. No subprocess. Just a function call and a struct assertion. The test reads like the behavior it describes.

This covers the majority of real logic — filtering, aggregation, validation, business rules. Standout didn't *invent* the idea of testing a pure function; it made sure the surrounding framework doesn't tempt you away from it.

> **Verify:** Pick a handler in your app. Write a test that calls it directly and asserts on the returned data. If you can't, the handler has logic tangled with side effects — that's the real bug.

### Intermezzo A: What the architecture already bought you

**What you got for free:**

- Handlers are pure functions; logic tests are straightforward `fn() -> Result<T, E>` tests.
- Output data is a `Serialize` struct. You can also assert on it as JSON (useful for cross-language consumers).
- Argument parsing is clap's problem. Clap has its own extensive test suite — you don't need to re-test it.
- Template rendering is `standout-render`'s problem. Its test suite covers MiniJinja syntax, tag parsing, style resolution, output modes.

**What's left:**

- **Integration** — does the full pipeline (argv → dispatch → handler → render → stdout) actually work for this command?
- **Environment-dependent behavior** — does this command react correctly to piped stdin, a missing env var, a narrow terminal, no color support?
- **Filesystem-dependent behavior** — does the command find, read, and write files in the right places?

These three are where CLIs traditionally fall back to subprocess-based e2e tests. That's what the rest of this guide is about.

## 3. The remaining gap

Let's be precise about what the architecture *doesn't* solve and why subprocess tests are tempting.

**Integration.** Even with clean handlers, a bug can live at the seam: an argument you thought was global isn't, a hook mutates state the handler doesn't see, a template references a field that doesn't exist. You want to assert on the *rendered output* of a full invocation, not just on the handler's return value.

**The environment.** CLIs read from the environment in a dozen places: `$EDITOR`, `$HOME`, piped stdin, the clipboard, the terminal width, whether stdout is a TTY, whether the terminal supports color, the current working directory, files at specific paths. Any of these can change behavior. None of them are the handler's "input" in the argv sense.

**Filesystem state.** Your command may need to read a config file at `~/.myapp/config.toml`, write a lockfile, list entries in a working directory. Testing this with real paths pollutes the developer's machine; testing it by hand-rolling temp dirs in every test file duplicates code.

The default answer is:

```rust
#[test]
fn list_shows_todos() {
    let output = Command::cargo_bin("myapp")
        .unwrap()
        .args(["list"])
        .assert()
        .success()
        .get_output()
        .stdout
        .clone();
    let text = String::from_utf8(output).unwrap();
    assert!(text.contains("buy milk"));
}
```

This works. It's also:

- **Slow.** Spawning your binary is tens to hundreds of milliseconds, not microseconds.
- **Opaque.** If it fails, you get the stdout blob and a non-zero exit. You can't step into it, you can't inspect intermediate state.
- **Brittle.** The assertion is on rendered text; any presentation change breaks it.
- **Hostile to invariants.** Want to assert "the command set no env var as a side effect"? "The JSON payload had exactly these keys"? "A specific template was selected"? Good luck.

Subprocess tests have a place — and section 6 below names it — but they shouldn't be the default.

## 4. The `standout-test` harness

`standout-test` gives you a fluent builder that runs your app *in-process* with full control over the environment, then hands back a `TestResult` with typed accessors and assertion helpers.

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dev-dependencies]
standout-test = "7.5"
```

The smallest possible test:

```rust
use serial_test::serial;
use standout_test::TestHarness;

#[test]
#[serial]
fn list_runs() {
    let app = build_app();              // your normal App::builder().build()?
    let cmd = build_cli_command();      // your clap Command

    let result = TestHarness::new().run(&app, cmd, ["myapp", "list"]);

    result.assert_success();
    result.assert_stdout_contains("buy milk");
}
```

That's it. `run()` drives the same dispatch path as production — same clap parsing, same handler lookup, same render pipeline — and returns the rendered text. No subprocess, no stdout capture gymnastics.

> **Why `#[serial]`?** The harness mutates process-global state (env vars, cwd, terminal detectors, default input readers). Tests that use `TestHarness` must run serially. The `serial_test::serial` attribute is re-exported from `standout_test` for convenience: `use standout_test::serial;`.

> **Verify:** Add a `TestHarness::new().run(...)` test to your app. It should run in under 10ms, not 100ms.

### 4.1 Env vars

Your command reads `$EDITOR`? Set it:

```rust
#[test]
#[serial]
fn respects_editor_env() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .env("EDITOR", "vim")
        .run(&app, cmd, ["myapp", "note", "new"]);

    result.assert_stdout_contains("opening vim");
}
```

Need to *remove* an env var that exists on your dev machine?

```rust
.env_remove("HOME")
```

Both are backed by real `std::env::set_var` / `remove_var`. The originals are captured before the run and restored when the `TestResult` drops — including on panic unwind, so a failing assertion never leaks state into the next test.

### 4.2 Fixtures and working directory

For commands that read or write files:

```rust
#[test]
#[serial]
fn reads_config() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .fixture("config.toml", r#"format = "short""#)
        .fixture("todos/today.md", "- buy milk\n- write tests\n")
        .run(&app, cmd, ["myapp", "show"]);

    result.assert_stdout_contains("buy milk");
}
```

Each `.fixture()` call writes a file into a freshly created `tempfile::TempDir`. The first fixture call also sets that tempdir as the working directory for the run, so handlers using relative paths just work.

You can access the tempdir directly if you need absolute paths as handler arguments:

```rust
let harness = TestHarness::new().fixture("input.txt", "hello\n");
let path = harness.tempdir().unwrap().join("input.txt");
let result = harness.run(&app, cmd, ["myapp", "cat", path.to_str().unwrap()]);
```

Fixture paths must be relative and stay inside the tempdir — absolute paths and `..` components are rejected so a stray fixture can't clobber your real home directory.

### 4.3 Piped stdin

Want to test the "CLI piped as input" path?

```rust
#[test]
#[serial]
fn reads_from_stdin() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .piped_stdin("draft text\n")
        .run(&app, cmd, ["myapp", "publish"]);

    result.assert_stdout_contains("draft text");
}
```

Any handler built on `standout-input::StdinSource::new()` — or on `standout_input::read_if_piped()` — transparently sees the mock. It reports `is_terminal() == false` and reads the content you supplied.

The counterpart:

```rust
.interactive_stdin()    // StdinSource::new().is_terminal() reports true; nothing to read
```

### 4.4 Clipboard

Same story for the system clipboard:

```rust
.clipboard("https://example.com/pasted-url")
```

`ClipboardSource::new()` returns the mock content; no shelling out to `pbpaste` / `xclip`.

### 4.5 Terminal state

Three orthogonal knobs, all routed through Phase 1's environment detectors:

```rust
.terminal_width(80)     // forces a fixed width for tabular layouts
.no_color()             // forces OutputMode::Auto to behave like Text
.with_color()           // forces Auto to behave like Term even when piped
.no_tty()               // stdout reports as not-a-TTY
.is_tty()               // stdout reports as a TTY
```

Useful for snapshot testing: pin the width, turn off color, and the rendered string is deterministic across developer machines and CI.

### 4.6 Forcing an output mode

Sometimes you want to assert on structured output regardless of what the user's `--output` flag would have chosen. Instead of manually appending `--output=json` to argv:

```rust
#[test]
#[serial]
fn list_as_json_has_expected_shape() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .output_mode(OutputMode::Json)
        .run(&app, cmd, ["myapp", "list"]);

    let value: serde_json::Value =
        serde_json::from_str(result.stdout()).unwrap();
    assert!(value["todos"].is_array());
    assert_eq!(value["todos"].as_array().unwrap().len(), 3);
}
```

If your app renamed the flag via `AppBuilder::output_flag(Some("format"))`, tell the harness:

```rust
.output_flag_name("format")
```

### Intermezzo B: A full-pipeline test, in-process

**What you achieved:** Your integration tests run in the same process, in microseconds, with complete environment control.

**What's now possible:**

- Assert on both the rendered output *and* the handler's return data in the same test (via `result.outcome()`).
- Test env-dependent branches without touching `std::env` from your test code directly.
- Pin terminal width and color for snapshot tests.
- Replace a subprocess-based integration suite with a harness-based one; watch the run time drop by an order of magnitude.

**What's next:** A worked example, and the boundaries — what the harness still can't do.

## 5. A worked example

Let's test a todo CLI end-to-end. The app reads todos from `$TODO_FILE` (or `todos.txt` in the cwd), supports adding via argument or piped stdin, and renders either as a styled list or as JSON.

```rust
use clap::Command;
use serial_test::serial;
use standout_test::TestHarness;
use standout_render::OutputMode;

fn app() -> standout::cli::App {
    // your real App::builder() -> build()
    todo!()
}

fn command() -> Command {
    // your real clap Command definition
    todo!()
}

#[test]
#[serial]
fn list_shows_todos_from_cwd_file() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .fixture("todos.txt", "buy milk\nwrite tests\n")
        .run(&app(), command(), ["todo", "list"]);

    result.assert_success();
    result.assert_stdout_contains("buy milk");
    result.assert_stdout_contains("write tests");
}

#[test]
#[serial]
fn list_prefers_env_var_over_cwd_file() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .fixture("todos.txt", "from-cwd\n")
        .fixture("other.txt", "from-env\n")
        .env("TODO_FILE", "other.txt")
        .run(&app(), command(), ["todo", "list"]);

    result.assert_stdout_contains("from-env");
    assert!(!result.stdout().contains("from-cwd"));
}

#[test]
#[serial]
fn add_reads_from_piped_stdin_when_no_arg() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .fixture("todos.txt", "")
        .piped_stdin("buy milk")
        .run(&app(), command(), ["todo", "add"]);

    result.assert_success();

    // The handler wrote to todos.txt in the fixture tempdir — read it back
    // to confirm the side effect.
    let path = TestHarness::new().tempdir().unwrap().join("todos.txt");
    let contents = std::fs::read_to_string(path).unwrap();
    assert!(contents.contains("buy milk"));
}

#[test]
#[serial]
fn list_as_json_is_valid_and_shaped() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .fixture("todos.txt", "a\nb\nc\n")
        .output_mode(OutputMode::Json)
        .run(&app(), command(), ["todo", "list"]);

    let v: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(result.stdout()).unwrap();
    let items = v["todos"].as_array().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(items.len(), 3);
    assert_eq!(items[0]["title"], "a");
}

#[test]
#[serial]
fn list_without_color_strips_ansi() {
    let result = TestHarness::new()
        .fixture("todos.txt", "one\n")
        .no_color()
        .run(&app(), command(), ["todo", "list"]);

    assert!(
        !result.stdout().contains('\x1b'),
        "expected no ANSI escapes in output, got: {:?}",
        result.stdout()
    );
}
```

Every test reads like a statement of behavior. Nothing runs in a subprocess. Nothing depends on the developer's real home directory or clipboard. Every test restores the environment on drop.

### Intermezzo C: Integration tests that don't suck

**What you achieved:** A full integration test suite that runs in under a second, covers env-dependent branches, and breaks only when the behavior actually changes — not when someone tweaks a template.

**What you traded:** Your tests are `#[serial]` (they mutate process globals). For a CLI binary that isn't a library dependency of a massive workspace, this is almost never a problem — CLI test suites are small enough that serial execution is fine.

## 6. What the harness still can't do

Be honest about the boundaries. There are things you shouldn't try to test in-process:

**Real PTY behavior.** If your CLI drives progress bars, raw-mode TUIs, or prompts that sniff `isatty()` on a PTY (not just on the `StdinReader` abstraction), the harness can't simulate that. Use `rexpect` or `expectrl` with a spawned subprocess.

**Signals.** SIGINT / SIGTERM handling only makes sense against a real process.

**Subprocess fan-out from your app.** If your handler shells out to `git`, `rg`, `$EDITOR`, or any other external program, the harness can't intercept that call. *This is the focus of Phase 3 of the test-tooling work — a `ProcessRunner` abstraction that routes through `CommandContext`, with a mock variant for tests. It's not yet shipped; until it is, shell-outs remain a boundary.* In the meantime, structure handlers so the shell-out is a trait you can swap for a mock in the handler's tests directly.

**Binary-level concerns.** If you're testing that the compiled binary has the right linkage, exits with the right code, or handles `--version` through a specific path — that's genuinely integration-of-the-build, and a small `assert_cmd` suite is the right tool.

The goal isn't to replace subprocess tests entirely. It's to reduce them to the small set of cases where they're actually earning their keep.

## 7. Cheat sheet

```rust
TestHarness::new()
    // environment variables (real OS env, restored on drop)
    .env("KEY", "value")
    .env_remove("KEY")

    // working directory and fixture files
    .cwd("/some/path")                       // explicit cwd
    .fixture("notes/todo.txt", "content")    // writes file, sets cwd to tempdir
    .fixture_bytes("data.bin", vec![1,2,3])

    // terminal detectors (see standout-render::environment)
    .terminal_width(80)
    .no_terminal_width()
    .is_tty() | .no_tty()
    .with_color() | .no_color()

    // forced output mode (injects --output=<mode> into argv)
    .output_mode(OutputMode::Json)
    .text_output()                            // shortcut for OutputMode::Text
    .output_flag_name("format")               // if AppBuilder::output_flag was renamed

    // stdin (routed through standout-input's default reader)
    .piped_stdin("content")
    .interactive_stdin()

    // clipboard (same)
    .clipboard("content")

    // execute
    .run(&app, cmd, ["binname", "subcommand", "--flag"])

// TestResult
result.assert_success();                // Handled / Silent / Binary
result.assert_no_match();               // clap didn't match any subcommand
result.assert_stdout_contains("hi");
result.assert_stdout_eq("hi\n");
result.stdout();                        // &str
result.outcome();                       // &RunResult, for bespoke assertions
result.binary();                        // Option<(&[u8], &str)> for Binary
```

## Appendix: common pitfalls

- **Tests leak state into each other.** Every test that uses `TestHarness` must be `#[serial]`. Parallel execution mixed with process-global mutations is unsupported.
- **A `TestHarness::new()` without `.run(...)` does nothing.** The harness is `#[must_use]` — inert until you call `.run`.
- **`output_mode(...)` injects `--output=<mode>` into argv.** If your app uses a different flag name (via `AppBuilder::output_flag(Some("format"))`), set `.output_flag_name("format")`.
- **Detectors reset to library defaults, not to prior overrides.** Don't mix a `TestHarness` with a manually installed `set_*_detector` on the same thread; the harness's `Drop` will wipe your override.
- **Handlers that bypass `standout-input`.** If a handler reads stdin directly via `std::io::stdin()` instead of `StdinSource::new()` or `read_if_piped()`, the harness's `.piped_stdin()` won't reach it. Prefer the abstractions.
