# Rendering and output

Standout renders human output in two passes:

```text
serializable data -> MiniJinja -> semantic [style] tags -> terminal style transform
```

Keep templates in files and style semantic tags with CSS:

```jinja
[title]Todos[/title]
{% for item in items %}
{{ item.title | style_as(item.status) }}
{% endfor %}
```

```css
.title { color: cyan; font-weight: bold; }
.done { color: green; }
.pending { color: yellow; }
```

`embed_templates!` accepts `.jinja`, `.jinja2`, `.j2`, `.stpl`, and `.txt`. `embed_styles!` accepts CSS plus legacy YAML. A stylesheet filename supplies its theme name. Prefer CSS and MiniJinja for new application code.

## Text versus formatting

`{{ value }}` always displays data as literal text: brackets and backslashes show as written, and terminal controls (ESC, CR, ...) show as visible spellings such as `\u{1b}`; newline and tab still lay out. This holds in tables and event output too. Never escape brackets in handler data, and never put `[tag]` markup or ANSI in a string expecting it to style.

- Fixed style: write the tag in the template, `[error]{{ message }}[/error]`.
- Style chosen by data: `{{ value | style_as(name) }}`. A tag assembled as `[{{ name }}]` is a template error, and so is a literal fragment with an incomplete tag or unpaired backslash; escape literal brackets in template source as `\[`, `\]`, `\\`.
- Styled pieces built in Rust: put `FormattedText` fields in the CLI view type (`FormattedText::text(s).styled("path")?`, `.append(...)`, `from_ansi_sgr` for a library's colored output). Keep it out of library models.
- `append`, `join`, `style_as`, padding, `col`, `truncate_at` and tables keep formatting; `~`, `string`, `replace` and slicing return plain text.
- There is no `verbatim` filter, `{% autoescape %}` is rejected, and `safe`/`escape`/`e` grant no styling.

Structured encodings serialize a `FormattedText` as its plain text with no style metadata. Rules and supported SGR: `crates/standout-render/docs/topics/templating.md#text-and-formatted-values`.

## Output modes

The global `--output` flag names a structured encoding; the human representation has no `--output` name and is what a bare invocation renders. Neither changes the handler's data:

| Representation | Result | Agent use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none (bare invocation) | Template; ANSI per `--color` and the destination | Normal user output |
| `term-debug` | Template with tags preserved | Inspect style placement |
| `json`, `yaml`, `csv` | Direct serialization; template skipped | Parse or assert on data |
| `ndjson` | One compact JSON object per line: handler events, then `{"type":"result","data":…}` | Consume a stream while the command runs |

`--color auto|always|never` is the separate decision about escape sequences in human text; a structured encoding never carries them. Only a command declared `pageable` pages its complete human output on a terminal; `--no-pager` turns that off for the run.

An unknown style tag, authored or named by `FormattedText`, degrades to unstyled text in the human representation and is recorded as a warning (`AppBuilder::strict_style_tags(true)` or `STANDOUT_STRICT_STYLE_TAGS=1` makes it fail the run); term-debug keeps it literal. Structured encodings also skip injected template context.

`csv` takes flat records only: one map of scalars, or an array of them, one row each in declared column order. A nested value is a render error naming `CsvProjection`; declare the columns with a `CsvProjection` on the command when the handler data is not flat. There is no XML mode.

Under a structured mode a failure is a diagnostic document on stdout and the exit status is unchanged: `docs/topics/execution-outcomes.md` owns where each stream's bytes go per mode, `docs/topics/error-handling.md` the `Diagnostic` a handler returns, and `docs/topics/stability.md` the versioned document (`ContractSurface`, `Envelope`, `schema_version`). A successful run declares a nonzero status with `Output::with_exit_status` or `list_view(items).empty_exit_status(n)`.

A command whose result accrues while it runs takes `results: &mut Results<E>` as a third handler parameter and calls `results.emit(event)`; register it with `EventsFnHandler::new` or let `#[handler]` read the parameter. The human representation renders each event from `<name>.event` beside the command's template, one flushed write each; `ndjson` writes each event raw on its own line and the summary as the `result` record; `json`, `yaml` and `csv` build one document when the command ends — the events, the `result` record and the warning entries as an array, or the events as CSV rows with the summary not encoded. A handler never branches on the representation (`docs/topics/incremental-commands.md`).

Prefer `--output json` plus a parser whenever an agent needs facts rather than presentation. Use `--color never` on a bare invocation when the rendered wording matters. Do not scrape ANSI output.

`--output-file-path=PATH` writes output to the file and suppresses duplicate stdout, and wins over the pager. Applications rename or disable each of the four flags through `AppBuilder`, and name themselves with `AppBuilder::name` so `<NAME>_PAGER` is read before `PAGER`.

Read `crates/standout-render/src/output.rs`, `crates/standout-render/docs/topics/templating.md`, `crates/standout-render/docs/topics/styling-system.md`, and `docs/topics/output-modes.md` for the detailed surface.
